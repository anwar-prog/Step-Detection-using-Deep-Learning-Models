# Step-Detection-using-Deep-Learning-Models
Developed deep learning models (CNN, LSTM, Transformer) to detect and classify steps using accelerometer and gyroscope data from wearable sensors. Implemented data preprocessing, model training, validation, and testing using PyTorch, achieving efficient step detection with CSV output for analysis.

Developed models using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Transformer architectures to detect and classify steps based on accelerometer and gyroscope data collected from wearable sensors, including data from both clipped CSV files and step-mixed annotation files collected from wearable sensors. Implemented data preprocessing, including handling missing values and assigning labels based on indices. The model was trained on features extracted from accelerometer and gyroscope data to classify between 'start', 'end', and 'no step' states. Used PyTorch for model development of all three architectures and employed Q-learning to improve the decision-making process. Built a complete pipeline for training, validating, and testing the model, achieving efficient step detection and outputting results to CSV for further analysis.
