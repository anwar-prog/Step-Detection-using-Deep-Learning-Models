# Step-Detection-using-Deep-Learning-Models
Developed deep learning models (CNN, LSTM, Transformer) to detect and classify steps using accelerometer and gyroscope data from wearable sensors. Implemented data preprocessing, model training, validation, and testing using PyTorch, achieving efficient step detection with CSV output for analysis.
